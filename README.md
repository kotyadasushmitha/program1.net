1.My application is about purchasing iphones which varies based upon the model and the memory.
2.Initially I will check whether the user wants to continue or quit.
3.If the user continues, he/she needs to enter the name, iphone model and the amount available to purchase the mobile.
4.I have used a switch case that checks for the model number say, IPHONEX32.
5.Based upon the iphone model , I will provide the actual cost of the iphone excluding tax and discount, and also it calls the function calculation() and balance().
6.The function calculation() returns decimal value. Based upon the memory size, it calculates the total cost of iphone including tax and discount if applicable.
7.The function balance(), does not return any value, it just calculates the remaining balance available with the user or will inform how much more money is needed to purchase the mobile.
